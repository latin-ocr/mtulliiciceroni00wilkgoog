M. TULLII CICERONIS

A. F. P. R. idque diceret esse, actum fide Ρ. Rutilii; Rutilius
autem, ante iactum, post relatum3 C. Canius, eques Romanus,
cum Rufo adesset, exclamat, neutrum illis litteris declarari:
‘quid ergo?’ inquit Scaurns3 ‘Aemilius fecit, plectitur Rutilius!
⁵ Ridentur etiam discrepantia: ‘quid huic abest nisi res et virtus?' ¹70
Bella etiam est familiaris reprehensio quasi errantis; ut cum
obiurgavit Albium Granius quod, cum eius tabulis quiddam
ab Albucio probatum videretur, [et] valde absoluto Scaevola
gauderet· neque intellegeret contra suas tabulas esse iudicatum.
¹0 Huic similis est etiam admonitio in consilio dando familiaris, aaa
ut, curn patrono malo, curn vocem in dicendo obtudisset,
suadebat Granius, ut mulsum frigidum biberet, simulac domum
redisset, ‘perdam’ inquit ‘vocem, si id secero : ” ‘melius est'
inquit ‘quam reum.’ Bellum etiam est, cum quid cuique sit aaa

gesting that it had been spent in bribery:
Rutilius explained it as intended to re·
mind him that it had been entered, some
time aiter it had been paid; Canius, who
was assisting Rutilius in his deience, gave
a witty turn to the entry, by explaining
‘Aemilius was guilty, and Rutilius is
⁴ getting punished.’

5. discrepantia, instantes in which a
sudden turn is given to the thought,
practically equivalent to jokes παρὰ
προσδοκίαν. One would have expecteda
question like that in the text to end with
the mention· os something of slight im·
portance, whereas ‘res et virtus' comprise
almost all extemal and personal advan-
tages, ‘property and merit.’ Reid on
p. Balb. ξ 9. Hence Quintil. vi. 3. 84
rightly quotes this as an instance ‘decipi-
endi opinionem)

7. Albium Granius: this is not only
the reading of the best MSS. but the only
one which suits the character of Granius
as a wit. The old reading ‘Albius
Granium ’ is rejected by all editors since
Ellendt. But none ot‘ the other suggested
alterations os the text is needed. Albucius
(iii. 43. 171) accused Scaevola de repe-
tundis (Brut. 26. 102), and to establish
his case called ior the account-books ol a
certain Albius, a friend oi Scaevola’s.
ln spite of the evidence thus supplied,
Scaevola was acquitted. Granius taunted
Albius ¹with having been delighted at the
acquittal, aad at the same time not having

seen that a severe condemnation had
been passed upon the accuracy ol his
own accounts. (lt is not necessary with
Ell. to suppose that they were judged
to have been intentionally salsified.) For
et ...neque corresponding cp. Holden on
deortui. 25. 953 Roby, § ²24¹· Some
MSS. give Albucio, which is wrong: ab
Albucio we might perhaps translate ‘in
favour of A’ tRoby,§ 1813), but it is
simpler to take it of the agent ·‘ by.’

11. vocam obtudisset, ‘had made his
voice husky :’ cp. Lucr. iv. 612 ‘et tamen
ipsa quoque haec, dum transit clausa
domorum, l vox optunditur, atque auris
confusa penetrat Ι et sonitum potius quam
verba audire videmur.’ So Quint. xi. 3.
ao ‘fauces tumentes strangulant vocem,
obtusae obscurantz’ he treats ol the
management os the voice in ἕξ 14-29‚
and opposes clara vox to obtusa.

12 mulsum: cp. Mart. xiii. 108 ‘ Mul·
sum . . . Attica nectareum turbatis mella
Falernum ' Macrob vii. 12 ‘mulsum quod
probe temperes, miscendum esse novo
Hymettio et vetulo Falern02’ cp. Hor.
Sat. ii. 4. 26. Hence it is not to be trans·
lated ‘mead,’ but‘ amixture ol honey and
wine.' Cp. Becker Gall.² iii. 311.

15. consentaneum, ‘corresponding to
the character.' Oi Pompeius Phrygio
nothing is known: phrygio is an ‘eun'
broiderer in gold ε ’ the name is doubtless
derived from the Phrygiam, who were
famous in this art: but the passage from
