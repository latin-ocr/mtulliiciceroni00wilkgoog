M. TULLII CICERONIS

segregare abs te ausu’s aut sine illo Salamina ingredi?
neque paternum aspectum es veritus?
numquam illum aspectum dicebat, quin mihi Telamo iratus
furere luctu tilii videretur3 at idem inflexa ad miserabilem

⁵ sonum voce,

cum aetate exacta indigem
liberum lacerasti, orbasti, exstinxti3 ‘neque fratris necis,
¹ neque eius gnati parvi, qui tibi in tutelam est traditus
flens ac lugens dicere videbatur; quae si ille histri0, cotidie cum
ιο ageret, tamen [recte] agere sine dolore non poterat, quid Pa-
cuvium putatis in scribendo leni animo ac remisso fuisse? fieri
nullo modo potuit. Saepe enim audivi poetam bonum neminem 194

6. cum Lamb Ell. cum codd. opt. : legebatur quem.

inclusit Em. quem sequuntur Pid. KS.

Salmasius, which has found much favour,
‘spondaulia‚‘ as G. Hermann (Opusc. i.
304) well shows, is inconsistent with
, ‘dicentis' ‘dicebat' ΤΙιε word is only
known from Diomedes, 476. 13.

Pid. adopts Jeep’s ‘excellent' conjecture
‘ut sua sponte alienaz' but this is far
removed from the MSS, and is not strongly
recommended by the sense: ‘sua sponte’
can hardly be forced into meaning ‘as if
they were the expression of his own feel·
ings.’ Hermann's ‘e sponda illa' is better
than any other suggestion, but the ‘couch’
of Telamon was not well-known enough
to bear the epithet ‘illa’

1. segregare, sc. Aiacem. Teucer was
engaged in a night-foray, when Ajax com·
mitted suicide: Soph. Aj. 342, 564, 720.

In the Teucer of Pacuvius, imitated from
a (lost) play of Sophocles bearing the
- same name, Telamon was represented as
full of wrath at his illegitimate sou
Teucer for having returned without his
half-brother Ajax. He banished him from
Salamis, and Teucer withdrew to Cyprus,
where he founded a new Salamis. Cp.
Hor. Carm. i. 7. 21 ff. Soph. Aj. 982 ff.

3. illum aspectum=illud vocabulum
‘aspectum ε’ cp. iii. 38. 154 ‘ille senius
desertus‘=that phrase ‘senius desertus:’
de Nat. D. ii. 3. 7 ‘ex quo illa (the ex·
pressione) ostenta, monstra, portenta, pro-
digiadicuntur.' Nagelsb.Stil.p.23. Hence
Lambinus's conjecture illud is needless.

6. indigem liberum, ‘bereft of my
children,’ not, Ithink, proleptic as Sorof
takes it, so as to include the banishment
of Teucer, but referring only to Ajax, or
rather to the bereaved condition of Tela·

mon, generally ‘childless' Τ11ε shorter
form of the genitive is quite as common,
even in prose writers, as the longer form,
iiiihilhc‘pffiiiiapifiieg, ‘ii a...

7. fratris necis, sc. ‘memor fuisti,' or
some similar expression. “

8. gnati, sc. Eurysaces, the young
son ol Ajax by Tecmessa, a princess ο1
Phrygia, whom he had captured and made
his mistress duringthe course of the Trojan
war. For the scansion ‘neque eius' cp.
Lachmann, Lucr. p. 161. Ell. wrongly
lengthens ‘nec' aud makes ‘eius’ arnono-
sllable.
y<est tradimus: cp. Soph. Aj. 562 τοῖον
πυλωρὸν φύλακα Τεῦκρον ἀμφί σοι l λείψω
τροφῆς ἄοκνον ἔμπα, cel τανῦν Ι mimis
οἰχνεΐ, δυσμενῶν θήραν ἔχων.

9. cotidie, in practice, Isuppose: there
was no such thing as a regular theatre
open daily at Rome. It may however
refer to the repetition of the same play
several times during gemes which lasted
over several days.

10. [recte] is rightly rejected asaworse
than otiose gloss (which spoils the com·
parison with the poet) by all editors since
Ernesti, except Ε11., who accepts Mat·
thiae's defence of it, but this ignores the
point: in spite ol the familiarity arising
from daily repetition, the actor could not
deliver this passage without really feeling
its pathetic character himself.

quid: cp. i. 17. 79 (note); iii. 9. 343
de Nat. D. 1. 27. 78 ‘quid censes, si ratio
esset in beluis, nou suo quasque generi
plurimum tributuros fuissei' Holden in
