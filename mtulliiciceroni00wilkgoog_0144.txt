DE ΘΚΑ T ORE II.

Et

quamdiu ad aquas suit, numquam est emortuus,

68 Genus hoc levius et, ut dixi, mimicum, sed habet non numquam
aliquid etiam apud nos loci, ut vel non stultus quasi stulte cum
sale dicat aliquid: ut tibi, Antoni, Mancia, cum audisset te5
censorem a M. Duronio de ambitu postulatum, ‘aliquando'
275 inquit ‘tibi tuum negotium agere licebit! Valde haec ridentur
et hercule omnia, quae a prudentibus [quasi] per dissimulationem
[non intellegendi] subabsurde salseque dicuntur. Ex quo genere
est etiam non videri intellegere quod intellegas, ut Pontidius 10
‘qualem existimas, qui in adulterio deprehenditur?’ ‘Tardum l'
ut ego, qui in dilectu Metello, cum excusationem oculorum a me
276 non acciperet et dixisset ‘tu igitur nihil vides?' ‘ego vero’

with filins. (Cp. p. 147 ‘medius fidius
compositum videtur et significare Iovis
filius, id est Hercules quod lovem Graece
Διάἐῑ nos Iovem, ac fidium pro filio,
quod saepe antea pro L litera D ute·
bantur).’ Dionysius represents the name
by Ζεὺς πίστιος. Cp. PrelIer, Rom. Myth.
pp. 633—637. The editors have tried to
torture some further meaning out of this
absurd answer than that which lies on
the sursace: there is no need to lind in it
more than a joke παρὰ προσδοκίανι ¹Ah,
Ithought she was some relation: she is
so like youl’

, 2. Quamdiu, ete: apparently an iambic
senarian with the first syllable omitted,
and fuit pronounced as a monosyllable.
Here the point ol the joke seems to he
that the man ought not to have lett the
baths,presuming that he was convalescent,
ior as long as he was there, he never
died.

4. apud nos, sc. ‘oratores‘ vel, not
‘even' but with the anticipation of a
second vel, which does not occur, the
sentence passing into an anacoluthon, and
the thought being continued by ‘ex quo

enere.' ,

g5. Mancia, ξ 266: nothing else is
known of him.

7. tuum negotium agere licebit:

to!

8, [quasi] and [non intellegendi]

12. dilectu KS cum codd. opt. delectu Ρ.

have been rightly seen to be glossas,
though Ellendt defends them. There is
no difficulty about the construction of the ¹
latter phrase: cp. de Fin. ii. 3² ‘volup-
tas nihil dolendi‚’ and Reid on Acad. ii.
34. 11 r, ‘probandi species’

10. Pontidius, not otherwise known:
some phrase like ‘roganti . . . respondit'
is understood. For tardum the interro·
gater expected something like ‘scelestum'
Quint. vi. 3. 87 reproduces the same story,
without the name.

12. in dilectu,·lor the war against
Jugurtha. Cp. Sall. Jug. 43 ‘(Metellus)
diffidens veteri exercitui, milites scribere,
praesidia undique arcessere :’ in ac. 109.
Ellendt, bya curious oversight supposes
that this answer was given by Antonius!
and hence argues at length that the
Metellus could not have been M. Nu-
midicus. Soros gives ec. 125 as the birth-
year os Caesar: this seems a deduction
lrom the sact that he was curule aedile
in nc. 90, bnt even so the deductiori is
not sound, for the normal age for an
aedile was 37: and no citizen was liable
ior service until he was ryyears ol age
(Gell. x. 28): hence we must assume
Caesar to have been born at the latest in
nc. 127. He stood ior the consulship in
nc. 88, without having been praetor, and
this violation ol the lex crinalis led to a
violent and successful opposition to his
election on the part ol Sulpicius when
tribune. (Mommsen, iii. 2603 Ihne, R. G.
v. 280.)

Metello, ξ 263.
