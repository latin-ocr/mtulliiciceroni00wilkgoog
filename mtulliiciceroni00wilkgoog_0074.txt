‘restat ut hoc dubitemus uter potius Sex.
Roscium occiderit;' like ἀπορῆσαι, ‘to

more likely to be a correction.

a. P. Decius: thepraenomenisomitted

aud the general rule, which requires its
insertion only in formal statements or
when the personis mentioned with some
respect (well illustrated by Ellendt on iii.
1. 4), allows us to dispense with it here.
There seemsto be uo evidence todetermine
whether this Decius is the same as the
prosecutor of Opimius; although the con·
text somewhat favours this view. Nor

well-known adherent of the Gracchi.

3. genus et sd naturam universam,
practically a hendiadys, the latter clause
serving to detine the former. The con·
struction goes ou somewhat loosely: it
might be stated more completely thus:
‘quod sumptuosus est aliquis, id argu-
mentum revocetur oportet ad quaestionem
de luxurie: ete.

7. ad comunes rerum et generum
summas, ‘to the general conceptions em·

8. forsitan. ..videanturt so always
with Cicero, who does not forget that the
word is contracted from sors sit aa: but
in Livy we lind the indicative pretty
frequently, though even with him the sub·

on the charge of receiving money illegally,
or simply charged with it. If Ihne is
right in his conjecture that the prosecutiou
of Opimius was merely a trick of the
oligarchical party, in order to secure an
approval of their policy by a judicial vote
atatime of strong‘Conservative reaction'
(Rom. Gesch. v. p. 110), it is quite con·
ceivable that Decius was afterwards prose·
cuted by the popular party for praevari-
catio. But our only other authority for
the prosecution (Cic. Orat. part 30. 106),
adds nothing to our knowledge of the
circumstances. It is to be noticed how-
ever that in that passage Cicero twice
omits the praenomen. In Brut. 28108
Cicero says ‘Flacci autem aemulus P.
Decius fuit, non infans ille quidem, sed
ut vita, sic oratione etiam turbulentusz’
so far aa ¹this gessitis in favour of Ihne's

Liv. Synt. p. 226). The poets use the in-
dicative freely: Kiihner, ii. 614.

12. et defensionum, non locorum:
this isevidently thereadingrequiredbythe
sense of the passage: although a man, who
is not used to group all phenomena under
their proper genera and species, may think
that the various questions sor the judges
are extremely numerous, yet it is the par·
ticular charges or particular defences
which are infinite in number, not the

(qiu ¹

general lines of argument. Pearce, and κ

(independently) Piderit corrected the MS.
reading ‘non defensionum aut locorum‚'
which is due only to a misunderstanding
of the concrete force of defensionum.

Quae vero, etc. ‘But the cases where
there is no dispute as to the facts of the
case, but the question tums upon their
